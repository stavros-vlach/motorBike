The surfaceFeatureExtract utility has been superseded and replaced by the more
general surfaceFeatures utility.

surfaceFeatures reads a surfaceFeaturesDict input file with a much
simpler, more convenient format.  Example surfaceFeaturesDict files
can be found in the tutorial and template cases, e.g. located as
follows:
find $FOAM_TUTORIALS -name surfaceFeaturesDict
find $FOAM_ETC -name surfaceFeaturesDict
